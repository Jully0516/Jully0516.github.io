                In 2005, California passed the 'California Video Game Decency Act', which aimed to restrict the sale of violent video games to minors. Entertainment Merchant Association and Entertainment Software Association challenged the Law, arguing that video games are protected under the First Amendament of the US Constitution. The Supreme Court concluded that this law violated the constitutional right to free speech for these following reasons:
                1. Video games are a form of art and expression protected by the First Amendment just like books, plays and movies.
                2. The violence is different from sexual content that has been historically regulated.
                3. There is insufficient evidence that violent video games cause violent behaviours in players.

                In April 2013, the 'Four Major Addictions Act' was proposed in South Korea by Congressman Shin Eui-Jin. The bill was designed to classify Gaming Disorder as a disease with gambling, drugs, and alcohol. A lot of controversy arose around this bill due to insufficient scientific evidence and opposition from the game industry and the public. This was a small version of WHO's later proposal to include Gaming Disorder in ICD-11, however, they did not find enough support to pass the bill at the time.

                In May 2013, American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the DSM-5, which included 'Internet Gaming Disorder' as a sector 3 which is a condition for further study. While they acknowledged that excessive gaming can lead to significant impairment, they noted that there was insufficient evidence of the correlation between gaming and mental health issues. The following diagnostic criteria were proposed for further research:
                1. Preoccupation with gaming
                2. Withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away
                3. Tolerance, the need to spend more time gaming
                4. Unsuccessful attempts to control gaming

                1. Lack of clear causal links between gaming and mental health issues.

                In September 2018, Rumpf et al. published a rebuttal paper supporting the WHO's proposal. They agreed with the inclusion of Gaming Disorder in ICD-11 for the following reasons:
                1. Public health systems need this classification to provide better and faster treatment.
                2. Inclusion in ICD-11 would widen insurance coverage and give easier access to treatment for individuals.
                3. Clear diagnostic guidelines would be applied to prevent overdiagnosis and misuse of the diagnosis.

                In May 2019, at the 72nd World Health Assembly, the WHO unanimously adopted the ICD-11, which included 'Gaming Disorder'. The evidence they cited for this decision was mostly based on clinical reports which are published in East Asia. Official ICD-11 addresses Gaming disorder as follows:
                "Gaming disorder is characterized by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behavior which may be online or offline."
                1. impaired control over gaming
                2. increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities
                3. continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.
                The behavior pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern of gaming behavior may be continuous or episodic and recurrent. The gaming behavior and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe."

                In late 2019, Oxford University researchers (including Przybylski) continued to publish studies refuting the WHO's criteria. They argued that the WHO's diagnostic criteria were subjective and lacked transparency. They highlighted that the criteria were largely derived from substance use and gambling disorders, failing to account for the specific nature of gaming culture.

                Shortly after the WHO's decision, China's National Press and Publication Administration announced strict regulations. Minors were limited to 90 minutes of gaming on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends. Reuters suggested that the WHO's decision was used as a justification for these regulations. Also, this brought concerns on E-sports industry since many professional gamers start their careers as minors.

                Ironically, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the WHO launched the #PlayApartTogether campaign. Only a year after classifying gaming as a disorder, the WHO partnered with major game companies like Nintendo and Sony to encourage people to play video games as a healthy way to maintain social distancing. They were criticized for this inconsistency in their stance.

                The results showed <b>no significant correlation</b> between time spent playing games and mental health deterioration. This was a significant blow to the "addiction model" which often conflated high engagement with pathology.

                In the US, the focus shifted from 'disease' to 'consumer protection'. The FTC fined Epic Games over $500 million for using "Dark Patterns" to trick players into making unintended purchases. This signaled that the US government viewed the issue as a matter of unfair business practices and consumer manipulation rather than a mental health disorder.

                In 2023, the US Surgeon General issued an advisory warning that social media and excessive gaming could pose risks to children's mental health. This framed the issue as a broader "public health crisis" related to the digital environment, rather than focusing solely on the individual pathology of gaming addiction.

                In May 2024, the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) released the results of a 5-year longitudinal study. They announced the results through a panel survey that "The youth's excessive immersion in games is caused by psychological and social environmental factors such as academic stress and parenting attitudes rather than the game itself."
                1. The gamers who were diagnosed as patients from the WHO's criteria on the first year of the research mostly recovered from it in 5 years without treatments. (more than 99%)
                2. The reason of video game addiction is due to other problems, not game itself. Video games were used as a shelter to get out from the stress.
                3. People played video games, because they were depressed; the cause and effect is reversed.
